## Swift 2.0
Currently we maintain a [branch](https://github.com/Yalantis/PullToMakeSoup/tree/swift_2.0) to provide support for Swift 2.0.

##Requirements
- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 6.3
- Swift 1.2

##Installing with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'PullToMakeSoup', '~> 1.0'
```

##Usage

At first, import PullToMakeSoup framework:

```swift
import PullToMakeSoup
```

Create refresher:


```swift
let refresher = PullToMakeSoup()
```

Add refresher to your UIScrollView subclass and provide action block:

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefresh(refresher, action: {
     // action to be performed (pull data from some source)
})
```

After the action is completed and you want to hide the refresher:

```swift
tableView.endRefresing()
```
 
You can also start refreshing programmatically:

```swift
tableView.startRefreshing()
```

Component was implemented based on [customizable pull-to-refresh](https://github.com/Yalantis/PullToRefresh)
